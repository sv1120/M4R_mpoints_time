# M4R_mpoints_time
mpoints extension with time-dependent base rate which is piecewise constant. Includes, beyond mpoints, a function estimate_hawkes_base_rate which estimates the base rate, given some impact and decay coefficients - similar, but only optimising base rate (see log likelihood gradients derivation)
